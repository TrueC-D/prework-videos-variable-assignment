# Variable Assignment

## Learning Goals
+ Describe how expression are used in programming
+ Identify the different parts of an expression
+ Identify the return value of an assignment expression
+ Describe the Variable Lookup Expression
+ Describe the Assignment Expression
+ Identify the constant expression
+ Explain how the constant expression creates agreement

## Outline
Start with an open text editor with a blank ruby file - IDE Sandbox will work well. 

+ Describe how Ruby parses through expressions
  + All code is just text in a text file that lives on a computer
  + When we execute our program, the ruby interpreter reads through the code, evaluates each expression, and gives it a return value. 
  + An expression like "1 + 1", Ruby interprets this expression, and knows to return 2
+ Talk about why to use variables
  + If all of our programs used constant data like this, that wouldn't be very interesting. 
  + If you think about an app like Twitter or Facebook - those are only interesting because of dynamic data. You can show different things to different people. 
  + We can accomplish this using variables - a variable is something that can have many different values of the course of our program. 
  + We can assign it using a single equals sign.
  + number = 5, then do a bunch of math on the number. Then change number to 7 and run it again.
+ Constants 
  + Useful to call-out values that don't change during the course of our program
  + Age in Dog Years - developer might change it from 7 to 4, but it won't change during our run time
  + In Ruby, you'll typically see this to call attention to important stuff
  + Maybe bring up magic numbers here
